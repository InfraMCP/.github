# InfraMCP Organization

Welcome to **InfraMCP**, a curated collection of open-source Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers that enable secure, AI-driven management and automation across your entire infrastructure stack. Our projects provide seamless integration with leading platforms, empowering AI agents, developers, and automation tools to interact with complex environments using a unified protocol.

## What is Model Context Protocol (MCP)?

MCP is an open standard for exposing infrastructure and application context to AI assistants and developer tools. Each MCP server acts as a bridge between your systems and AI-powered workflows, providing structured tools for querying, managing, and automating your environment.
